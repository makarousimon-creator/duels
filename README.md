# Eon — the cycle of life

Minimalist web experience about the glow of life. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (desktop or mobile) to play.

- **Move** with arrow keys / WASD, swipes, or on-screen arrows.
- Collect shimmering memories to grow and brighten.
- Crossing your own path dims the light. After three crossings, fade into a brief pause, then be reborn into a slightly changed world.

No score. No end. Just the cycle.
